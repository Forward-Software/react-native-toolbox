## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md).

Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

## Getting Started

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Report bugs using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/Forward-Software/react-native-toolbox/issues)

Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Forward-Software/react-native-toolbox/issues/new/choose)

#### Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** should contain:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can, the sample code should allow _anyone_ with a base setup to reproduce your issue
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

### We use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes happen through Pull Requests

We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue your pull request!

#### Use a consistent Coding Style

This project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to maintain a unified coding style.
Before committing your changes remember to run `yarn lint` and check possible warnings and errors.

#### Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project.
Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.
